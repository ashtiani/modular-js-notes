- Create an array of "movie" objects.
- Each movie object has properties like
    - title
    - release date
    - rating
    - director
    - list of actors
- Create an input
    - use the `keyup` event to grab the value of this input as the user types
    - if the value of the input matches the title of a movie from your movies array, display that movie's info on your page somewhere
